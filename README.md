The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 
The dataset was for the Year 2000 containing 12 zip files (for each month(Jan to Dec) and was processed in one large HDF file containing three datasets (1) geotransform, (2) timestamps, and (3) precipitation. Precipitation has a large matrix (size of (x, y, time)). 
A seasonal map ( December-January-February, March-April-May, June-July-August, September-October-November) of precipitation data was created using the TRMM grid
